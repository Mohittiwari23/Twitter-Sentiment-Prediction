# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression
### Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model to analyze and predict user sentiments from tweets. The model processes raw Twitter data, applies text preprocessing techniques, and classifies sentiments into predefined categories (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral).

### Features
Preprocessing: Handles noise in tweets (e.g., hashtags, mentions, special characters).
Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF.
Classification: Trains a logistic regression model for sentiment classification.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix analysis.

### Dataset
The model uses a dataset of tweets labeled with sentiment classes. Ensure the dataset is placed in the specified directory before running the notebook.

### Results
The trained logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 77.6% on the test dataset.

For detailed analysis, refer to the included plots and confusion matrix in the notebook.

### Future Enhancements
Explore advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
Integrate real-time Twitter data streaming.
Expand the dataset for diverse sentiment coverage.
